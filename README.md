## How the app functions:
* The frontend of the app uses 'handlebars' to template and 'materialize' as styling for the articles, navbar and footer. 

* The webapp uses 'cheerio' and 'request' node package modules for webscraping found in 'controller.js' file.

* The backend of the app uses 'mongoose' to interact with 'mongodb' and 'express' to handle the routes for the server.
